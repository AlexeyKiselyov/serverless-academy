## Guide:

1.  <a href = "https://nodejs.org/uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Need
    NODE.js.</a>.
2.  Write in terminal `cd src`.
3.  Write in terminal `npm i` to load modules.
4.  Write in terminal:

- `npm start` or `node index.js` to launch json sorting function.

5.  You will see the result of program in the console.

In this task, we'll dive a little deeper into working with JSON.

So you have a list of 20 API endpoints. Here they are:

https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-793 https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-955
https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-231 https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-931
https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-93 https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-342
https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-770 https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-491
https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-281 https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-718
https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-310 https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-806
https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-469 https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-258
https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-516 https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-79
https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-706 https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-521
https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-350 https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-64

Each of them returns a response in a different format and with different
key/value pairs. But they all have one thing in common - absolutely all GET
requests return JSON that has an isDone key with a boolean value. The queries
are divided into four types, where the key/value pair you're looking for is on
different nesting levels.

### Requirements

1. Write an application that queries all of the aforementioned endpoints. Design
   a scenario where a request will be sent several times (up to three times is
   enough) in case the previous request fails. If there is no response, exclude
   the result from the output, but print the error in the console. Execute
   queries sequentially through async/await;
2. In all received endpoints you need to find the isDone key and find out
   whether it is True or False.

The output of your app should look like this:

- $ node json-sorting.js
- [Success] https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-1: isDone - True
- [Success] https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-4: isDone - False
- [Success] https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-2: isDone - False
- [Fail] https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/json-5: The endpoint is unavailable

- Found True values: 14,
- Found False values: 6
