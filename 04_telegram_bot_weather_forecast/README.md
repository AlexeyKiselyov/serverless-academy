This task is a good way to practice and understand: what third-party REST APIs
are and how to work with them.

Your task: write a bot that will give the user the weather forecast for a
particular city. Choose the city according to your taste or where you live, it's
not critical.

### ‚ùïBot requirements

- The bot should be able to return a weather forecast for every 3 hours, or for
  every 6 hours at the request of the user.
- The menu structure should be represented by the buttons: "Forecast in Nice" ‚áí
  "at intervals of 3 hours" / "at intervals of 6 hours" (one button, after
  clicking on which a menu with two more buttons opens).

### üõ†Ô∏èTools and APIs you need to use

- OpenWeather API (API docs). you should use this specific endpoint ‚Äî
  https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?appid=.....
- node-telegram-bot-api to create your bot logic
- Axios to make API calls against OpenWeather API
