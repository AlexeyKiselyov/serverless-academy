<h2 align = "center"> Task description.</h2>

Your first task is to write a small CLI application without any external
dependencies that expects the user to enter a few words or numbers separated by
a space. Next, the program should ask how to sort the user's input.

The complete flow should look like this:

1. Wait for user’s input
2. Ask what the user would like to see in the output - what operation to do with
   words and numbers, namely:
3. Sort words alphabetically
4. Show numbers from lesser to greater
5. Show numbers from bigger to smaller
6. Display words in ascending order by number of letters in the word
7. Show only unique words
8. Display only unique values from the set of words and numbers entered by the
   user
9. To exit the program, the user need to enter exit, otherwise the program will
   repeat itself again and again, asking for new data and suggesting sorting

### NOTE:

Please make sure you’re not using any external npm or yarn dependencies. You
should only use NodeJS built-in modules. Also, the execution of your application
takes place strictly in the console.
