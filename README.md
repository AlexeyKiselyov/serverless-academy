# Backend practice (serverless-academy)

# FAQ

## What should I know before starting the tasks

This course is not designed to teach everything from scratch, it is just designed to give you practical skills in solving a wide range of problems. For this reason, it is assumed that you already have a minimal understanding or experience with the following:

- Git
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript (NodeJS) and its ecosystem, or any other language
- Working with the terminal at a basic level

We also strongly recommend allocating 1-2 hours every day to solve algorithmic problems on [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) or [codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

## What is the best order of tasks to solve

Just follow the sequence in which the tasks are published. **Do not move on to the next problem until you have solved the current one.**

## Where to put my task solution and how to share it with a mentor

We use GitHub repository to track your progress.

Your workflow should look like this:

- First you need to create a public repository on GitHub. Name it as `serverless-academy`.
- For the ease of navigation, do not create additional branches. Upload everything into the `main` branch.
- We expect that solutions for each task will be uploaded to its own directory.
  - Specify the serial number of the task at the beginning for easy navigation, do not use spaces in the names of the directories.
- Each task is an independent project, unless otherwise specified in the task itself. Each directory with a solution must have a `package.json` file.
- Make sure you do not upload `node_modules` directory to the repository. It always must be included in `.gitignore`.

Here is an example of thr perfect directory name: `01_cli_interactive_sort`.
